# GitHub Actions

Explore GitHub Actions and learn how to create workflows for automating tasks within your repository. Set up a basic GitHub Actions workflow to trigger on pull requests. Build a resources repo and present your work back to the group.

## Research

- What is CI/CD?
- What is branch protection and why should the `main` branch only be updated by a pull request?
- What are [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)?

## Setup

- Build a React, TypeScript, and Vite project with Jest to explore GitHub Actions.
- Make the [main branch protected](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).
- Add some mock unit tests to the project.

## Actions

- Configure the GitHub Actions workflow to include steps for running unit tests upon each pull request to the main branch.
- Configure the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy the project upon successful merging of a pull request into the main branch.
- Test the CI/CD pipeline by creating pull requests with changes to the project and verifying that unit tests run automatically.
- Ensure that successful pull request merges trigger the deployment workflow, resulting in the updated project being deployed to the chosen hosting platform.

## Presentation

- Create a shared repo to contain your work.
- Document your findings, challenges faced, and solutions implemented throughout the research process.
- You will present what you have found back to the rest of the group and share the resources repo.
